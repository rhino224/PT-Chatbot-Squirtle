# PT-Chatbot-Squirtle
Working on a Chatbot to help with Physical Therapy documentation

Plan to start incorporating additional features that will be more focused on Physical Therapy Documenation. 

I am very very new to software engineering, but it is very fun so we will see where this goes!

Starter Roadmap:
1. Create Chatbot GUI
2. Create Chatbot
3. Add Context and Conversation Hisotry to Chatbot Conversation. 
4. Create Text Replacement Program GUI
5. Create Text Replacement Program with .txt file
6. Text Replacement Program - Transition to using JSON files
7. Incorporate 'State_Questions' - for chatbot to ask during client sessions
8. Create a Toggle for 'PT Mode' & 'Normal (chat) Mode'
  - This would hopefully change weather the chatbot focuses primarily on PT Note Documentation
